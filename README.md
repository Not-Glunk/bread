poorly written fancy python script to manage a .csv

based on the idea of using hashes of `<website>+<passphrase>` as your passwords<br />
when running in special characters or length constraints, make use of the "pepper" and "format" columns<br />
if you need to encrypt pre-set credentials, or store whatever data, it can also do aes256 encryption, same logic

run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install eventual dependencies <br />
manually edit the .csv if need arises idk, bye
